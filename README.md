# ue4-VRCharacter
An Unreal Engine 4 character class with VR in mind.

__Note:__ This does not implement motion controllers as I'm using blueprint for them. In order to implement thumbstick movement you will need to extend this class in blueprint and then call ThumbstickMovement on event tick with the direction you want to move.
